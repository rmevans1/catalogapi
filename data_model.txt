Not trying to bash Apple, but in my opinion Microsoft has stepped up their game in innovating new things. I was debating whether to buy the SP4 or not. But hearing from many good things about the SP3 I decided to take the chance. First off the SP4 is great! It is extremely fast and has a sleek design. Being a full time student and an estimator; I needed something that could be reliable. Having had high expectations for it, I can say that I haven't been disappointed.",

            body: "I really like the Surface Pro 4, I bought 4 for my small company. When the devices work they are flawless smooth and responsive which I will say its about 90% of the time. However many times the touchscreen stops responding, or the pen does not write. On one of the devices the screen starts to flicker and some of the apps close by themselves when in Tablet Mode and the only way to get it to work is by force shutting it off. I also bought 4 keyboards and a lot of times the trackpads do not work. I figure most of those issues can be fixed with updates, however as of right now they are very annoying.",

I accidentally dropped mine getting into my car half an hour after getting it and it now has cracked glass all over the upper right side of the back. Not likely repairable, as this phone is glued together and water resistant. Otherwise, excellent phone with bright highly readable screen, and FAST! Battery seems to take all day to wear down.",

Prior to that I had problems with Samsung and other android products being great internet and video devices but horrible phones. I have the iPhone 6 Plus and needed a separate phone for work. I went in thinking I would just get another iPhone. I had seen the commercials for the Galaxy S7 and decided to take a chance on it since reviews were good on it and it was different than what I had. I choose the S7 edge and have to say that it is nothing but amazing. Great battery life, amazing camera puts the iPhone to shame, easy to use great options. I like the ability to use to apps split screen. The phone works great syncs quickly to my truck and the sound quality is amazing. If you are thinking about this phone get it you won't be disappointed. This phone has changed my mind about the quality and quality control of Samsung.",
